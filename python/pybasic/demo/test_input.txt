A short history of the company

World Wide Spam was started in the summer of 2000. The business
concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both through
bulk email and by selling canned meat online.

after receiving seral complaints from customers who weren't satified
by their bulk email. World Wide Spam altered their profile, and
focused 100% on canned goods. Today, they rank as the world's 12,892nd
online supplier of SPAM.
