* BotClean
The goal of Artificial Intelligence is to create a rational agent
(Artificial Intelligence 1.1.4). An agent gets input from the
environment through sensors and acts on the environment with
actuators. In this challenge, you will program a simple bot to perform
the correct actions based on environmental input.

Meet the bot MarkZoid. It’s a cleaning bot whose sensor is a head
mounted camera and the actuator are the wheels beneath it. It’s used
to clean the floor.

The bot here is positioned at the top left corner of a 5*5 grid. Your
task is to move the bot to clean all the dirty cells.

* Input Format

The first line contains two single spaced integers which indicates the
current position of the bot. The grid is indexed at (0,0) on the top
left and (4,4) on the bottom right. The x co-ordinate increases from
top to bottom and y co-ordinate increases left to right.

5 lines follow representing the grid. Each cell in the grid is
represented by any of the following 3 characters. ‘b’ (ascii
value 98) indicates the bot’s current position, ‘d’ (ascii
value 100) indicates a dirty cell and ‘-‘ (ascii value 45) indicates
a clean cell in the grid.

* Output Format

The output is the action that is taken by the bot in the current step
and it can be any of the movements in 4 directions or cleaning the
cell in which it is currently located. The valid output strings are
LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN or CLEAN. If the bot ever reaches a dirty
cell, output CLEAN to clean the dirty cell. Repeat this process until
all the cells on the grid are cleaned.

* Sample Output

* Task

Complete the function next_move that takes in 3 parameters posx, posy
being the co-ordinates of the bot’s current position and board which
indicates the board state to print the bot’s next move.

* Scoring

Your score is (200 - number of moves the bot makes)/40. CLEAN is considered a move as well.

Once you submit, your bot will be played on four grids with three of
the grid configurations unknown to you. The final score will be the
sum of the scores obtained in each of the four grids.
