Princess Peach is trapped in one of the four corners of a square
grid. You are in the center of the grid and can move one step at a
time in any of the four directions. Can you rescue the princess?

** Input format

The first line contains an odd integer N (< 100) denoting the size of
the grid. This is followed by an NxN grid. Each cell is denoted by
‘-‘ (ascii value: 45). The bot position is denoted by ‘m’ and the
princess position is denoted by ‘p’.

The top left of the grid is indexed at (0,0) and the bottom right is
indexed at (N-1,N-1)

** Output format

Print out all the moves you take to rescue the princess in one
go. Moves must be separated by ‘\n’ a newline. The valid outputs are
LEFT or RIGHT or UP or DOWN.
