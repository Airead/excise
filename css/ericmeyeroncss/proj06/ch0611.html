<h1>WidgetCo Inc. Posts Record Profits in 3Q 1999</h1>
<h2>Industry Leader Credits Hard Work, Determination, Licensing Fees as Keys to its Success</h2>

<p class="lead-para">
In its best performance since the company was founded in 1993, WidgetCo Inc. announced that its third-quarter profits for 1999 totalled $217 million.  "This only points to the continuing strength of WidgetCo and its wonderful, hardworking employees," said John X. Corphead, CEO and Chairman of the Board.  "With a workforce this dedicated, I have every confidence that our fourth-quarter earnings will be equally impressive.  I continue to be as proud as a new father of our company and its incredible products."

A pioneer in the fast-growing field of widget mass production and distribution, WidgetCo has introduced several new products over the last twelve months, including the industrial-strength Fusion Widget, the highly popular Farming Widget, and media darling Plaid Widget.  WidgetCo also holds the patents on several key widget technologies, including the industry-standard Parallel Widget Extruder C2100, and its reasonable licensing fees to other players in the widget-production industry has enabled it to remain a leader in this field.  A corporate restructuring and workforce-reduction initiative early in 1999 has helped boost profits to their current record levels, according to Corphead.  "By streamlining our workflow, we've made ourselves more flexible and adaptable, which is a necessity as we bring this company into the 21st century," Corphead says.
